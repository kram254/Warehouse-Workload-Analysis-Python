# Warehouse Workload Analysis
## Overview
The Warehouse Workload Analysis project is designed to analyze and visualize warehouse workload data using Python. It utilizes the pptx, pandas, and matplotlib libraries to create a PowerPoint presentation that showcases insights and trends related to warehouse orders, lines, and workloads. The presentation is generated dynamically based on provided data files.

## Features
Analyze and visualize warehouse workload data.
Create interactive PowerPoint slides with insightful graphs and analysis.
Provide detailed breakdowns of weekly workload, lines per order, and more.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

### Python 3.x
Required Python libraries (pptx, pandas, matplotlib)
